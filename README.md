#### VRSBS1Feeder - An ADS-B Feeder Using the Kinetic SBS-1 Receiver
This was programmed back in 2012, and I no longer have this device.

It is an example of the convolutions a company will go through to protect their data. Originally the data was delayed, but later the data was just sent in real-time, and the purpose of scrambling the data became obsolete.

The data scrambling using two CRC generators is novel.

This used the Java USB Driver from the Sourceforge project: https://sourceforge.net/projects/d2xx/

Uploaded for historical reference.
